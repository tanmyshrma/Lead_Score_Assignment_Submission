# Lead Scoring Case Study
## Problem Statement

An education company named X Education sells online courses to industry professionals. The company markets its courses via several platforms, when people fill up a form providing their email address or phone number, they are classified to be a lead. The current lead conversion rate at X education is around 30%. A typical lead conversion process can be represented using the following funnel:
The company requires a model wherein lead score is assigned to each of the leads such that the customers with a higher lead score have a higher conversion chance and the customers with a lower lead score have a lower conversion chance. The CEO, in particular, has given a 			ballpark of the target lead conversion rate to be around 80%.


## Data
You have been provided with a leads dataset from the past with around 9000 data points. This dataset consists of various attributes such as Lead Source, Total Time Spent on Website, Total Visits, Last Activity, etc. which may or may not be useful in ultimately deciding whether a lead will be converted or not. The target variable, in this case, is the column ‘Converted’ which tells whether a past lead was converted or not wherein 1 means it was converted and 0 means it wasn’t converted.

## Business Objective
The company requires you to build a model wherein you need to assign a "lead score" to each of the leads such that the customers with a higher lead score have a higher conversion chance and the customers with a lower lead score have a lower conversion chance. The CEO, in particular, has given a ballpark of the target lead conversion rate to be around 80%.
